Huplo- Heads Up Presention Layer
================================

Huplo is meant as a simple python collection of tools to overlay data sources on live video streams.

Huplo is Gstreamer based, and the basic gstreamer filter extends the CustomCairoOverlay, providing several simple servers that can be manipulated via GTK D-Bus.

Originally developed to display basic IRC chats on live video, it can be basically driven by any live data source, though at present the toolkit is only text related.
